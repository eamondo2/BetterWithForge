This mod will be separated into distinct tiers.
The first few tiers wil directly pull from betterthanwolves, and then after that, they will attempt to integrate other mods.
Tier0 - Starting phase
    Basically, the first tree punching and resource gathering phase.
    No tools to speak of, logs only drop one plank, and also take forever to break.
    One plank = 2 sticks
    cannot make wooden axe, and wooden picks only mine one block before breaking.
    This is the hardest phase.
    Also, re-vamped hunger mechanics, food scarcity, and increased fatigue from the amount of blocks/items carried.
    (iterate through inventory, store to array of stuff, update on changes, and affect the player's walking speed, as well as food decrease rate
    goals for this tier are to gather enough resources to make a stone pick, and to secure enough food
    to last for the first night.
    gathering surface coal is also important.
Tier1 - Begins when the player has enough cobble to make a few picks, and a temporary residence
    This tier is all about harvesting higher level resources. Iron mostly.
    Iron ore only drops piles of iron rubble, which only makes one nugget per ore in the beginning phase.
    the goal here is to get enough iron to make the smeltery pit, which requires iron in the recipe.
    Smeltery pit is a multiblock structure, 3x2, hole in the middle, and on activated
    forms an inventory that is identical to the furnace.
    This is the first machine/thing that I need to make.
    It provides a way to smelt piles of iron rubble into more than one iron nugget
    It also provides a way to get redstone, albeit really really slowly.
    redstone only drops the crushed ore, and cannot be refined until this machine is made
